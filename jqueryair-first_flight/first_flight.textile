h1. jQuery Air - First Flight

The First Flight tutorial is designed to be a gentle introduction to the why and how of basic jQuery usage.  It's intended for developers who are familiar with some programming language, but not JavaScript.  While we'll cover a bit of JS, the emphasis of the tutorial is to stay in the easy sandbox of jQuery.  We assume a working knowledge of CSS including basic IDs, Classes, and simple attributes.
