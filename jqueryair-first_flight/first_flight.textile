h1. jQuery Air - First Flight

The First Flight tutorial is designed to be a gentle introduction to the why and how of basic jQuery usage.  It's intended for developers who are familiar with some programming language, but not JavaScript.  While we'll cover a bit of JS, the emphasis of the tutorial is to stay in the easy sandbox of jQuery.  We assume a working knowledge of CSS including basic IDs, Classes, and simple attributes.

# Fuel Up
  * Why Use jQuery
  * Just Enough JavaScript
    * What JavaScript Looks Like
      * Lines end in ;
      * Blocks start with { and end with }
    * Creating variables
    * Simple data types
      * Strings
      * Integers
      * Booleans
        * true and false
        * evaluating to true and false
          * Outside of proper true and false, javascript can evaluate many values into a true or false result.
          * For example, any number other than zero evaluates to true. Any string that's not empty is true. Any function, object, or array, even if they're empty, evaluate to true.
          * On the other side, there are several things that evaluate to false.  0 is false as is the empty string "". There are three special values that all evaluate to false: null, undefined, and NaN.
          * Overall these are sensible, the only one that might trip you up is that an empty array, [], is true!
    * If/Else Conditions
    * Calling Methods
      * Method calls always use ()
      * Methods always return a value
      * Methods can be chained
      * Using the return keyword
    * Grouping Instructions
      * Functions are written like function(params){code}  <-- Necessary?
    * Logical Operators
      * ==
      * !=
      * ||
      * &&
    * Helpful Functions
      * alert()
      * parseInt()
